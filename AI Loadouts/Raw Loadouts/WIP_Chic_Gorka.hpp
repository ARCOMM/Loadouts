        AI GEAR CONFIGURATION
        Description: This is the section where you define loadouts for the AI teams.
        Notes:
            1. AI loadouts are randomized based on their probability settings.
                a. Probability between 0 and 1 (0 = 0%, 1 = 100%).
                b. If array elements don't add up to 1 then ranges are recalculated proportionally.
                c. To remove a default item use an empty string.
            2. This is an array of classnames.
            3. ARC_AI disables the use of grenades and grenade launchers for AI units.
            4. This handles any spawning of units whether it's Zeus, MCC or script.
            5. prioritizeTracerMags - true will only add tracer magazines if available (reverts to standard if none).
            6. removeMedicalItems - true will remove all ACE medical items.
            7. removeNightVision - true will remove all night vision goggles
            8. enabled - true will enable the custom AI gear for the given team, false will not
        Example:
            headgear[] = {
                {"H_HelmetSpecB_snakeskin", 0.8},
